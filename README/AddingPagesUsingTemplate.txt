For those wondering how to add new pages and still make it look like it fits into the website
This is the tutorial.

First you need to decide if its going to be an admin only page, an account page, or a community/
Server page.

For this example we are going to use the characters tools page that i created myself:

*You need to add 2 new pages, one for the template, and the other for the website core.

1.Core (script) File
-The Core file will always go in the "Components" folder.
-For an admin page, we are going to put the core file in this directory "components/admin".
-We are going to name the file "admin.chartransfer.php".
-For a server file, we would put the core file in this directory "components/server". The file
would be named in this format "server.YOURPAGENAME.php"

2.Template File
-The template file will always got in the "/templates/offlike/(admin)or(server)or
whatever kind of file you want. This example we will use the "admin" folder.
-For the Template file, you name it exactly as the core file you name earlier
(admin.chartransfer.php).
-If its a server page, you would put it in "/templates/offlike/server'. You would
name this file like this "server.YOURPAGENAME.php"

3.Next we have to add your new page to the main.php file so the website knows where and 
how to redirect your page. This is only done on the core side.
-to add your new page go "components/admin/main.php" or components/server/main.php etc.

Heres what you add to add your page:

'(YOURFILENAME, example:chartransfer)' => array(
        'g_is_admin',                            // g_ option require for view (require user to be admin(3)? Superadmin(4)? user(1)?
							Leave blank for guests)
        'chartransfer',                          // loc name (key) (Text for language file (/lang/en.english.php))
        'index.php?n=admin&sub=chartransfer',    // Link to  (server file would be like this 'index.php?n=server&sub=YOURFILENAME)
        '', // main menu name/id ('' - not show) (leave blank)
        0 // show in context menu (1-yes,0-no)          [4]

-just follow the examples of the other pages.

4.What do you put in the two different files????
A)

-for the core file, it will always have this on the top:

<?php
if(INCLUDED!==true)exit;
// ==================== //
$pathway_info[] = array('title'=>'YOUR PAGE TITLE', 'link'=>'index.php?n=admin&sub=YOURPAGENAME (for the example ->chartransfer)');
// ==================== //
?>

-This file contain all your functions and scripts.
-The core file also contains all the files you need to include.

B)
-for the template file, it will always contain this on top:

<br />
<?php builddiv_start(1, "YOUR FILE TITLE") ?>
<br />

-From here on out, its all straight php and html coding. What you type in you template file,
displays on the screen.
