If you are having troubles with the vote system, trust me, you arent/werent the only one ever. Here are some
cause/effect/fixes for a few things ive learned while helping you guys all out.

1. Errors

 A. Telnet connection problem: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond 
after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.

	Solution: Make sure your realm is online. Also make sure your server is accepting Remote Access requests. 
 This is checked by opening your server config, and finding ("RA.enable" and "RA.IP" and "RA.port")

 B. Telnet connection problem: -Not enough privileges.

 	Solution: This states that your current account doesnt have a high enough level to make the requested command
 happen. Make sure the account level is higher then the RA.minLevel. If using Trinity, make sure that the account
 has admin access on all realms... go ->realmd->account_access. make sure under realmId, it says "-1"

 C. Telnet connection problem: -No such user.

	solution: If using mangos, make sure the username is in ALL CAPS, in the config, aswell as the database.
 Also, trying changing config.xml -> vote_system -> vote_ra -> your realm -> revision. from 1 to 0, or vise versa.

2. When all else fails, check you ra_commands.log from your server directory. It will always say what the error was.
