For those of you running multiple realms, it may get alittle confusing to configure the website
to feature all realms. So i decided to write a tutorial on how to do it:

1.Open your config.xml, and scroll down to <multirealm>...Change the 0 to a 1.

2.Next, go to the website. Go into the admin panel, and select "Realms" under Site Managment.

3.In the empty fields below, enter you realm information. When you get to the Dbinfo column, enter
in this format: "mysql username;mysql password;mysql port;mysql IP address;world database name;character database name".
DONT FORGET the semi colon between each field.

4.Click create new realm... A window will pop up asking if your sure, click yes.

5.And boom, you should have it. Please note that all your realms must use the same "realmd"
database in order for it to work!
