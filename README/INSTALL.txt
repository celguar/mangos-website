--------------------------------
3. Web interface and Admin Panel
--------------------------------

Browse to your Mangos page and accept the ToS. Login to the MangosWeb using 
the administrator account you created in step 1-6.

Go to Context menu: > Admin Panel. Mousing can be a little tricky with the drop-down
menu. Hopefully the will fix this with future releases.

From the Admin Panel, you can set the variables for:
  - Users (Here you can edit users information such as account level. You can also ban users from here)
  - Site Settings (cant do anything here yet)
  - Realms (here you can add existing Realms. This is not the same as creating new ones)
  - Reg Keys (these are registration keys mailed to users to validate their accounts)
  - Languages (here you can add or delete languages from the Choose Language: menu
  - Donate Admin (configure your site to accept donations and to give reward/items for
                  donations)
  - Backup Management (Here you can backup your "character copy" characters here)
  - Forum Manager (create forum catagories and sub catagories)
  - Add News (add news to your front page)
  - Edit News (edit the news you have created)

--------------------------------------------
4. Setup News Forum to display on main page
--------------------------------------------

The news forum is not set up on the site initially. You will probably want to set 
this up, since news posting does not work without it. 

To begin:

 1. Login with your level 4 account (root admin access)

 2. Go to Context menu: > Admin Panel, click Forum

 3. Create new category and leave the order at 1. (News would be a good suggestion for
    a category, and if you changed your config/config.xml to a differen number for this section
    that is the number you should use.)

 4. News will now appear at the top of the page, click it.
 
 5. Create a new Forum subcatagory (by selected your newly created forum). You may want to give this a name that includes the name
    of your site. This will be in the RSS if you choose to publish this on the 
    internet.  Leave the order at one, unless you specified others in the config/config.xml.
    If you allow members to post new topics, then you may want to close this forum to
    the public.

    a) To close a forum, click the first icon - a page - a page next to the Topic.
       To open a closed forum, click the first icon again.

    b) To hide a topic from view without deleting it click the middle icon - a page 
       with a blue exclamation. To reveal a hidden forum, click the middle icon again.

    c) To post to a click the third icon - a page with a pencil. 
		  
 6. To post or edit a closed forum go to:
    Context menu: > Admin Panel > Add or Edit News

If you follow these steps exactly, and leave Default Component to frontpage, topics
you post here will appear on the main page. Very Blizzlike. And you can probaby see
why you don't want this section cluttered up with member comments :D.

-----------------------------------
5. How to setup the DONATION SYSTEM
-----------------------------------

To auto grant access to your donation template:
Run "./insatll/sql/482_account_extended_auto_granting.sql or 482_account_extended_manual_grating.sql,
to grant acccess manually.

    a) Create a premier paypal account. (It's free)
	
    b) From the PayPal menu, go to Profile > Under selling Preferences > Instant Payment 
       Notification Preferences.
    c) Select Instant notification
    d) Enter the full path including your domain name to donation.php in the root of your
       MaNGOS directory. 
       Example: http://you-domain-or-ip/subdirectoryifyouhaveone/donation.php

Everyone likes a little pat on the back for their donations, unless they're good
samaritans like me...and just doing good deeds is satisfaction enough. If they're not
like me :P, then you may want to reward them for their donations

To create, edit, or send donation packs and items, go to:
Context menu: > Admin Panel> Donate Admin or see table `donation_template`in the
realmd database.

*NOTE* Whenever somebody donates, it will show up in the donate admin as "send not sent items". An
admin or GM can send these items from the donate admin if people dont click on the "send items to in-game mailbox" 
option after donating.

TO TEST YOUR DONATION SYSTEM

1. open "donate.php" in your root directory

2. switch the comments out on these lines (24 - 27):

// If testing on Sandbox use:
//$fp = fsockopen ('ssl://www.sandbox.paypal.com', 443, $errno, $errstr, 30);

$fp = fsockopen ('ssl://www.paypal.com', 443, $errno, $errstr, 30);


3. go to https://developer.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/ and create a sandbox account.

4. go -> login -> click on link "Create a preconfigured buyer or seller account." ->
Edit the details to your liking.

5. next go -> test tools -> Instant Payment Notification (IPN) Simulator. -> ... For
the IPN handler url, enter the full url to your "donate.php". For payment type,
select "eCheck complete" and "payment type "instant".

... Make sure under the "custom" field, you enter a characters guid number, that you
can use to test and see if it fully works. Also, for testing purposes, under "item number", 
enter one on your donation packages, like "1" for example. 

6. You should see the information posted in the database, and you should be able to log in with the account that owns
the character ID you used, and click "send items to ingame mailbox" on the donate page. log in and check your mailbox :)

 !!!To give some or yourself root admin access to your webpage:!!!                                                 |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

--------------------------------------------
7. Setup the vote system
--------------------------------------------

1.1 Your server remote access should be turned on (look in your server config file for Ra.Enable).

1.2 Your telnet connection to the server remote must be working properly.

[Important] For the remote access user and pass you can use an existing Trinity/Mangos ACCOUNT or to CREATE a new one.

{NOTE} If your just updating from an earlier version of MangosWeb / TrinityWeb, Make sure you run the "install/sql/updates/
28_added_realmlist_colums.sql" on your realmd database.

1.3 For every realm, you must enter the RA information to the database. You can either do this manually by going ->realmd->
realmlist->('ra_port', 'ra_user', and 'ra_pass'). Or you can do this the easy way by going ->yousite.com->admin panel->realms->
(click your realm name)-> enter your RA info in the fields -> click "update".

[NOTE]  know that its GM level (ra account) must be set according to (not lower than) Ra.MinLevel in the server config file
and this user must have "send money" and "send items" commands active. If you have any problems, check the ra.commands.log file
that your sever creates "C:\YOUR SERVER ROOT\mangos\ra.commands.log"

2. If using trinity, open your "account_access" table in realmd database. Set realm ID for your telnet account to "-1"

3. To adjust the rewards or site links etc. "go -> admin panel -> Vote system Admin"

NOTE! The vote system is disabled through the config. look for <vote><enable>1</enable></vote>.

To remove the "click here to vote for us" logo on the frontpage, open "config/config.xml" Find <votelinks> add "<!--"
infront of that and add "-->" after </votelinks>. This will disable the vote system logo.


<!-- IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE VOTE SYSTEM... make sure to read the -> "./README/vote_troubleshooting.txt"!!!! -->
 
--------------------------------------------
8. Setup the chat system
--------------------------------------------

1. Create a database called chat, or use any exsiting database
2. Run the "./install/sql/chat.sql" on your chat database.
3. Configure your chat by editing "components/chat/lib/config.php"


NOTE! The chat system is disabled through the config. look for <chat><enable>1</enable></chat>

--------------------------------------------
9. Configuring Armory
--------------------------------------------

1.Create a database called "armory"
2.go ->"./install/sql/armory/3.X.X/" and extract "YourLanguage.Yourcountry.zip" (just extract the one you need).
3.Install from ./install/sql/Armory/ ("armory_cache.sql, armory_3.x.x_main.sql, (language folder) armory_3.x.x_LN.sql") 
on "Armory database"
4.Edit the ./armory/configuration/ "mysql.php, and settings.php"

--------------------------------------------
10. Changing the rules in the "Rules" page
--------------------------------------------

1.To change the server rules and account creation terms and agreement, simply open "./lang/acc_create_rules/
(language ab.).html. this changes the rules for both pages!
