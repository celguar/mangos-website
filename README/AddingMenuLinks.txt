== Adding links to the left hand menu under Mangosweb ==

In this tutorial we will add your Website's Myspace page to the Account Menu.

'''Step 1'''

	You need to decide on a link name and the location that link will point to

	i.e. Link name = Myspace
   	     Location = www.myspace.com/yourmyspacepage

'''Step 2'''

	Open /lang/en.English.lang with your favorite editor 
	(this step needs to be repeated for each language you are supporting)

	Type this line into the file    |=|MS :=: Myspace
	(you will see how the others are formatted, also try to put it at the top or bottom so its easy to find later if necessary)

	The MS is the pointer you will need to match up later and the Myspace is what will actually show in the menu

'''Step 3'''

	Open /core/default_components.php with your favorite editor 

	On this page you will see all the menus and how they are formatted

	Decide which menu you want your link to fall under and goto that section

	For our purposes we will use the account menu

	Under 2-menuAccount you will see 5 arrays, we are adding the sixth here

	at the bottom of the fifth array you will see:
{{{
	    ),
	  ),
	  '3-menuGameGuide' => 
}}}
	We are adding our link between the first and second ),

	It will now look like this
{{{
	    ),
	    6 =>
	    array (
	      0 => 'MS',
 	      1 => 'www.myspace.com/yourmyspacepage',
	      2 => '',
	    ),
	  ),
	  '3-menuGameGuide' => 
}}}
	The 0 index in the array is the pointer from the language page you added earlier. It will goto the MS pointer and retrieve Myspace
	The 1 index in the array is the destination you want the link to take you to

'''Step 4'''

	Close and save all of your changes and you are ready to go! Congratulations!
