== Adding links to the Quick Links Menu On the right side of the page in Mangosweb ==

In this tutorial we will add your Website's Myspace page to the Account Menu.

'''Step 1'''

	You need to decide on a link name and the location that link will point to

	i.e. Link name = Myspace
   	     Location = www.myspace.com/yourmyspacepage

'''Step 2'''

	Open /lang/en.English.lang with your favorite editor 
	(this step needs to be repeated for each language you are supporting)

	Type this line into the file    |=|MS :=: Myspace
	(you will see how the others are formatted, also try to put it at the top or bottom so its easy to find later if necessary)

	The MS is the pointer you will need to match up later and the Myspace is what will actually show in the menu

'''Step 3'''
	
	open /templates/offlike/body_right.php with your favorite editor

	Add links following this example:

<li class="e">
<a href="<?php echo mw_url('account', 'register'); ?>"><?php echo $lang['quicklink1']; ?></a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="<?php echo mw_url('server', 'realmstatus'); ?>"><?php echo $lang['quicklink3']; ?></a>
</li>

So your would look like this:

li class="e">
<a href="www.myspace.come/yourmyspacepage" /> <?php echo $lang['myspace']; ?></a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="" /></a>
</li>
