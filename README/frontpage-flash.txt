With the flash player on the front page, you have the option to load directly from the 
worldfowarcraft.com website, or used pre-saved ones within the flash folder. In order to 
switch between the online flashplayer(from wow.com) or offline flashplayer, you must rename
a couple files.

To use the flash directly from world of warcraft.com:
-rename the file "online_frontpage.index.php" to "frontpage.index.php" (/templates/offlike/frontpage/)
make sure to name the current "frontpage.index.php" to something else.
-reverse process to use offline flashplayer.
