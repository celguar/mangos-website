Updated for patch 3.3.2 by wilson212

The character copy system is a unique feature that allows admins to set up special accounts, and create max level 
characters, which users can copy as a reward (much like the "public test realm feature"). As of right now, the 
only way to charge users for this system is by spending vote points, but who says you cant charge money for that??

There are future plans to add a feature where users can spend real money for these "points", which allows them to
use the character rename system, character re-customization, character copy system, and buy the vote rewards.

To set this feature up:

1. create 2 new accounts, 1 for alliance, and 1 for horde characters.
2. on these accounts, go ahead and create a level 80 character with full tier gear.
3. go in the config ->"mangosweb folder/config/config.xml" -> look for ->  <character_copy_config> 
(around line 260).
4. It should already be enabled, all you have to do is edit how many points it costs users to copy a character, 
and the account numbers to the 2 accounts that you just made.
5. Now go to your site, login, and click "copy character" under account.
6. You should see the level 80 character you created, along with any other characters on that account, listed.

to copy a character to your personal account, click the "copy character" button. The character will be copied to
your account, along with whats in his/her bags, and the armor that character is wearing. The realm is decided by 
which realm you currently have selected.
